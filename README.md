# PRODIGY_DS-01

📊 Population Distribution Visualization

Overview
This project involves creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a selected variable (categorical or continuous) from a global population dataset. The data was sourced from the World Bank, which provides total population statistics by country and year.

🔍 Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:

Import real-world data from a reliable source.

Perform basic data preprocessing.

Visualize the distribution of population using either a bar chart (for categorical data such as countries or regions) or a histogram (for continuous variables like population ranges).

📁 Dataset
Source: World Bank Open Data

Indicator Used: Total Population (SP.POP.TOTL)

Format: CSV file with country names, years, and population counts

📊 Visualization Details
Tool Used: Python (with Matplotlib / Seaborn / Pandas)

Graph Types:

Bar Chart: Used to show population by country for a selected year
or

Histogram: Used to show how population values are distributed across all countries

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

🧪 How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/population-visualization.git

Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

Run the code to generate the visualizations.

You can modify the year or country filter as needed.

✅ Results
This visualization helps understand how the population is distributed across countries or how it changes over time. It serves as a basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) step in population-based studies or demographic analysis.

📌 Future Scope
Add more indicators like GDP, literacy rate, or urban population for multi-variable analysis.

Build interactive visualizations using Plotly or Dash.
